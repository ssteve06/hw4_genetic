To start the program, run the file called main.py 

The three parameters of the population object are the size of the inital population, 
the number of generations that should be run and the percent of children that 
mutate, must be in the range of 0 - 100.

This program creates a new generation by randomly selecting parents and giving
the child boxes from both in a new combination. If the parents are the same 
entity, the parent survives through the next generation. If the child mutates, 
boxes can be entirely deleted or added from the master list.
